and storage your own virtual money in cloud. Now this is the first version (1.1) of this project. But you can use this for
education or use as an example in your own project.

# Stack of technologies in this project:

2. Spring (Boot, MVC, REST, Data, Security).
3. Hibernate, JPA.
4. JWT token.

# Endpoint which is already exists:
Prefix: localhost:8090
1. POST: /app/user

In the nearly week I plans to add some endpoints and change security from simple jwt implementation to Oauth2 version.
